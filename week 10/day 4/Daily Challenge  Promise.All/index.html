1st Challenge
Instructions
Use Promise.all
This function should accept an array of promises and return an array of resolved values.
If any of the promises are rejected, the function should catch them.

Explain in a comment how Promise.all work and why you receive this output.

Example

const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 3000, 'foo');
});
// expected output: Array [3, 42, "foo"]
